# The REST Architecture

## 1. Separate API into logical resources

### Resource: Object or representation of something, which has data associated to it. Any information that can be named can be a resource

## 2. Expose structured, resources-based URLs

## 3. Use HTTP methods(verbs)

## 4. Send data as JSON(usually)

## 5. Be stateless

### Collections = Tables

### Documents = Rows
